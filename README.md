I'm *Mounish Pedagandham*, a 21 year undergraduate in CS from National Institute of Technology, Raipur (2020).  
I'm currently working in the field of Data Science & Deep Learning.
I love to travel, read books, and indulge in fitness. Also, a serious petrolhead.  
I am eager to share my experiences, journeys through short stories and my views & opinions on various issues.
